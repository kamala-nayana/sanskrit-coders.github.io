## Format
There is not much documentation online about MDict (mostly on Chinese forums), but it seems to use HTML for structure and CSS for design.

## Dicts

> I converted the dictionaries on [indic-dict](https://github.com/indic-dict/) to .mdx. You can download them [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rRIfJ5mhgP2Hv3sU3iVHzCdGzU0WZ3xA/view?usp=sharing) if you want to try out DictTango. I used this [script](https://github.com/sobaee/dict2mdx) for the conversion (It's not very intuitive). Use the [nice guide here](https://digitalpalidictionary.github.io/install_android_dicttango.html) on setting DictTango up.


  
## App
> I tried out [DictTango](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.jimex.dict&hl=en_CA), an android dictionary app that works with MDict (.mdx) dictionaries. It seems to be superior to GoldenDict. It loads 200+ dictionaries smoothly, has full text search support with regex, ability to group dictionaries together, LLM access and more. I've been looking for something like this for a long time now.
