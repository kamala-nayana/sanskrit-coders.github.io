## Yantra drawing
### Tool comparison
- **Adobe illustrator, CorelDraw**: heavy duty drawing programs can handle text & graphics. ([MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1303202939356536833)) 
  - downside, expensive. Also former has learning curve. 
- **Inkscape**: free vector graphics quite good for maNDala-s. ([MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1303202939356536833))
  - downside - handling nAgarI fonts. 
- **Geogebra**: best for geometric figures with complex constructions where even the trigonometry can be involved. Handles nAgarI fonts well. ([MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1303202939356536833)) 
  - Downside: not great at exporting vector formats.
- **TikZ for LaTeX**: good aesthetics; has internal calculation capacity but if involved I supplement it with calculations done in R. Gives good aesthetics & intuitively human-understandable language. Can be learned relatively quickly with examples. ([MT](https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1303202939356536833))
