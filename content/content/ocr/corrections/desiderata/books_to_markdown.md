Our expectation: when we read the corrected text, we expect to have atleast the same experience as reading the original pdf (if not better).

## Typing correct symbols
- Please use the correct symbols. Common mistakes: |(pipe) instead of ।(daNDa), :(colon) instead of visarga(ः).

### Special characters
If you cannot type unusual unicode characters, copy them from here and paste.

- IAST
  - ā Ā ī Ī ū Ū ṛ Ṛ ṝ Ṝ ḷ	Ḷ ḹ	Ḹ 
  - ṃ Ṃ ḥ Ḥ  
  - ṅ  Ṅ ñ Ñ 
  - ṭ Ṭ ḍ Ḍ
  - ś Ś ṣ Ṣ
- ISO 
  - ē ō r̥ r̥̄ l̥ l̥̄ ṁ
- Vedic Svaras
  - ॒ ॑ 

- No harm using ISO instead of IAST - we can fix it later.
- No harm ignoring initial letter capitalization (ie ṣ instead of Ṣ and so on).

## Formatting
- _italics_ - `_italics_`. **Bold** - `**Bold**`.
- Headings - `## Top heading`, `## Subheading`, `### Subsubheading` and so on. 

### Spacing
- Paragraphs are separated by empty lines. Please remove empty spaces at the beginning of lines.
- As far as possible, prefer paragraphs without any line breaks ("Enter" keystrokes). Just use word-wrap in your editor program.


### Quotes
- Please don’t use backticks (`). Use only ‘ or “.
- Ensure that quotes match (for example: 'the wife of the king, the man of _Devadatta_'. Or ”the wife of the king, the man of _Devadatta_”.). 
- Please make sure that the quotes are appropriately positioned - for example, 
  - this is bad: `'similar, '_ûnartha_, 'words, '_kalaha_ 'quarrel,'`
  - this is better: `'similar,' _ûnartha_, 'words,' _kalaha_ 'quarrel,'`
  - and this is best: `'similar', _ûnartha_, 'words', _kalaha_ 'quarrel',`. 
  - We're NOT OK with the "bad" punctuation, but ok with "better" and prefer "best" above.

### Footnotes


### Tables and charts
- Please generate tables using [this online tool](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables).
- Consider ditto marks or identical text associated with other text in a list (example [here](https://archive.org/details/ashtadhyayi/ashtadhyayi2?view=theater#page/n31/mode/1up)): Just repeat the text.
- In case of other cases/ confusion, please contact us with a link to the page with the table/ chart/ figure. Don’t hesitate to ask.

## Things to ignore
- Quotation mark placement which is not ‘bad’ as described in examples above - ie. don’t spend time trying to make it ‘best’.
- Empty spaces in lines. Don’t spend time correcting [spaces like this](https://i.imgur.com/On0RioK.png).
