# Samskrit Bharti Courses Management System
  ## Background
In Feb 2019, I did my first 10 days Samskrit Sambhashan Shibir. I came to know about this
course through whats app. I loved doing the course. But I realized that it took more than 11
years to reach that message to me. Samskrit Bharti Courses have lots of potential but it was not
reaching to many people in the country and outside. Many people like me are not even aware
that something like this exists. So I am determined to fix this issue using the power of
technology and social media.

In a few weeks I developed the first release of software. Details of capabilities are discussed
below.

  ## About System
Samskrit Bharti Courses Management System is a full featured cloud based solution that helps
teachers and volunteers to announce various Samskrit Bharti courses and run campaigns using
various social media platforms (facebook, whatsapp, instagram and many more). It allows
participants to see the courses offered and register for the courses they are interested in. During
the course days teachers can take the attendance of registered participants through the system.
Additionally teachers can share the course on major social media platforms directly through the
system. There are modules for online practice. After completion of course participants can take
the practice to learn and know where they stand.

  ## Major features

 * Allow Teachers and Volunteers to share the course details on various social media
platforms directly from the system

Students can then login to system and do the practice.
