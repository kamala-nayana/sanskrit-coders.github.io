## Engaging a publisher
An author may sell (some/ all) publishing rights to a publisher in exchange for "royalty" (usually small). Certain generous publishers may agree to online publication. 

### Distributing for free online
Despite publishing offline through some agency, some authors make it a point to distrubte their works for free on the internet (as pdfs etc.), some of them under a creative commons license. Examples:

- McComas Taylor's versified translation of the Viṣṇupurāṇa was published open access on the internet under CC-by-NC-ND ([pdf](https://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n8264/pdf/book.pdf)), while also being published and sold as a book by ANU press!
- Famed author NN Taleb made available freely available electronic version of "Statistical Consequences of Fat Tails" at [his website](https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/), while selling physical copies.
-  A South Indian Digest of Commentaries on the Nyāyasūtra - Gambhīravaṃśaja’s Nyāyasūtravivaraṇa—First Adhyāya by Oliver Philipp Frey,  [Brill Open access](https://brill.com/display/title/62014)

### Author's negotiation
- Try to retain the **right to distribute** your work **non-commercially**, and allow derivatives. Don't sign off all rights. 
  - Make an effort to bring up the concern. If it seems that you don't care, they won't care either.
  - You don't want to affect the publisher's revenue **while simultaneously** taking advantage of his (paper-)book-specific (editing and marketing) efforts. Argue the below for other modes of distribution -
    - They're often not in the same format as the printed version. Effort that goes into formatting html pages is quite different from that involved in page-editing/ latex work.
    - They usually don't affect revenue (those who read audio books or ebooks don't go for paper books). 
- If the publisher goes out of business or refuses to reprint when out of copies, will you be legally allowed to publish by some other means?
- Royalty.

## On-demand publishing
- Books are published and dispatched whenever a buyer places an order. यदा यदा क्रेता पुस्तकप्रेप्साम् प्रकटयति, तदा तदैव पुस्तकं चारु प्रकाश्य प्रेषयन्ति। मूल्यतः कतिचिद् भागं स्वयं रक्षित्वा शिष्टं लेखकाय प्रेषयन्ति।

- Comparison
  - Author would have to prepare the book himself
  - Author will have to self-market.
  - Purchase cost is higher for the buyer (Oft economics of scale don't apply).
    - In 2016: "I paid 38 rupees per copy for Mahaviri Hindi third edition 104 pages 80 gsm metric demy 8vo For 1000+ copies Pothi quotes 82.5 per copy"
